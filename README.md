# Madrid & Barcelona PostgreSQL User Group CFP

Welcome to the Madrid & Barcelona PostgreSQL User Group CFP (Call for Proposals) repository. This repository has been created to streamline the process of reviewing and managing talk proposals for our meetups.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. proposals
This directory is where contributors can submit their talk proposals. Each proposal should follow the provided template to ensure all necessary information is included. 

[Talk Proposal Template](https://github.com/Cucciman/postgresql-meetup-cfp/blob/main/proposals/PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md)

### 2. review
This directory is for organizers to review and discuss the submitted proposals. Proposals in this directory are currently under consideration and discussion.

### 3. selected
This directory contains the proposals that have been selected for upcoming meetups. Once a proposal is approved, it is moved here.

### 4. resources
This directory includes guidelines, templates, and other documentation for contributors. Refer to these resources to ensure your proposal meets our standards and requirements.

## How It Works

### Reviewing Proposals

## Labels
